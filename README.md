## Through My Eyes!

### Biography

I didn't necessarily love getting my clothes dirty when I was young. Rather than playing outside pencils and paper found me. In result art became my passion, over the years requests started to come. Everything I did was within the arts, from creating costumes for plays to be the one dancing, art always called.

In Highschool it was all about being ready with a plan after graduation. Grades were always high I was in every honor society there was and then boom, all of sudden senior year came rolling I didn't know what I wanted to do and time was slipping from my grip. Art was the only way I could express what I felt or what I wanted to feel.

A big surprise hit me all of a sudden, graduating early became my only option. Getting ready for a big move to Orlando, I got everything in a row for graduating before we left.
